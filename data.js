Hundreds upon hundreds of tiny dots of light penetrate the smoke, the very same incense sticks producing it.  The smoke is thick enough to taste. <br><br> Those who scout will discover a small chamber to the side of main room where air is free of smoke. Going to the side chamber requires standard endurance test, crossing whole room in one go would require a hard one. Using breathing aid grants Knack on these tests.",

        description: "The path abruptly ends at an automated train door that opens when approached. The train carts inside windows are made of stained glass, allowing an eerie light to filter in from outside. In the middle of the train car lies a sleeping skeletal humanoid figure, wearing an ill-fitting conductor's uniform, with its head replaced by a dimly glowing lump of coal. If it awakens, it will demand to see tickets. However, any technological item can confuse it long enough for you to pass without harm. Otherwise, it resembles a rail-punk themed Butcher (p. 188).  Defeating the Conductor could act as a connection goal",
